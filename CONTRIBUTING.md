Contributing to ONE Local - A Cooperative Project

Thank you for considering contributing to ONE Local! We are a cooperative, and our goal is to build and steward this project for the long-term benefit of our community. To ensure the sustainability and community-focused nature of [Project Name], and in alignment with our project license (MIT License + Commons Clause + Use Exceptions), we operate under a Copyright Assignment model. Please read the following terms carefully to understand how your contributions will be managed.

Understanding Copyright Assignment in our Cooperative Context

Unlike many open-source projects that operate on a licensing basis, ONE Local requires contributors to assign copyright of their contributions to the project owner ("the Cooperative"). We understand this is different from typical open-source contribution models, and we want to be transparent about why we've chosen this approach:

  Ensuring Long-Term Sustainability & Stewardship: As a cooperative, we are collectively responsible for the project's future. Copyright assignment allows the Cooperative to act as a unified entity to protect, maintain, and evolve the project over the long term, making strategic decisions in the best interest of the community. This approach is especially important for us given a past experience where a major contributor revoked permission to use their code. This revocation forced a significant rebuild, deeply impacting the co-op's resources and causing disruption within the Boulder community we serve. Copyright assignment helps prevent such destabilizing events in the future.

  Supporting Community Benefit & Our Mission: Our cooperative model is built to prioritize community benefit over individual profit. By owning the copyright, the Cooperative can responsibly manage the project's commercial aspects (as outlined in our license: MIT License + Commons Clause + Use Exceptions) to generate resources that can be reinvested in the project, supporting development, infrastructure, and community initiatives. This ensures the project's ongoing health and benefits our membership base directly. Furthermore, our license and this copyright assignment model are designed to allow for exceptions, enabling community organizations and non-profits to potentially use the project for community-benefit purposes under specific agreements. Please contact us if you believe your organization may qualify for such an exception.

  Preventing Future Licensing Inconsistencies: Copyright assignment provides clarity and avoids potential future fragmentation or licensing inconsistencies that can arise in projects where copyright remains distributed among many individual contributors. This unified copyright ownership simplifies long-term management and licensing for the benefit of everyone.

Terms of Contribution - Copyright Assignment

By contributing any code, documentation, or other materials to this project (your "Contributions"), you assign all right, title, and interest in and to the copyright of your Contributions to ONE Boulder Cooperative ("Project Owner"). This assignment is effective immediately upon submission of your Contribution.

As the copyright owner, ONE Boulder Cooperative is committed to:

  Maintaining the Project's Open and Community-Focused Nature: We are dedicated to keeping [Project Name] accessible for non-commercial use by the community, as reflected in our project license (MIT + Commons Clause).

  Transparent Stewardship: We will be transparent about how the project is managed and how any commercial activities are used to support the project and its community.

  Attribution and Recognition: We will ensure proper attribution for your contributions, as required by the MIT License and in line with community best practices. We deeply value and appreciate every contribution.

  Community Governance (Future Goal): As the cooperative evolves, we aim to further involve our community and membership in the governance and direction of the project, ensuring it remains responsive to community needs.

Important Considerations:

  Irrevocable Assignment: Please understand that this is a copyright assignment, and it is irrevocable. You are transferring ownership of your copyright to the Cooperative.

  Non-Commercial Use for Contributors (Generally): While the Cooperative owns the copyright, the project's license (MIT + Commons Clause) generally restricts commercial use for others without explicit permission. Exceptions for community organizations and non-profits remain possible under specific agreements.

  Contributions "As Is": Your contributions are provided on an "as is" basis, without warranty or liability.

By choosing to contribute, you acknowledge and agree to these Copyright Assignment terms. If you support our cooperative model and believe in the long-term community benefit of [Project Name], we warmly welcome your contributions.

If you have any questions or concerns about this Copyright Assignment model, please do not hesitate to contact us before contributing. We are happy to discuss it further.
