# Contributing to ONE Local

Welcome! Thank you for considering contributing to ONE Local, a cooperative project dedicated to building and stewarding resources for the long-term benefit of our community. We appreciate your interest in helping us grow and improve [Project Name]!

This document outlines the process and guidelines for contributing to ONE Local. Please read it carefully before making your first contribution. By contributing, you agree to abide by our Code of Conduct and our Contribution Terms, including the Copyright Assignment model described below.

## Getting Started

### 1. Understand the Project

Before you start contributing, take some time to understand what ONE Local and [Project Name] are all about.

- **Read our README:** Familiarize yourself with the project's goals, features, and technology stack.
- **Explore the Documentation:** If available, read through the project documentation to get a deeper understanding of its architecture and usage.
- **Check out the Website (if applicable):** Visit the project website to see it in action and understand its purpose in the community.

### 2. Set up Your Development Environment

To contribute code, you'll need to set up your local development environment. Here are the basic steps:

- **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have the necessary software installed. This might include:
  - [List specific software and versions, e.g., Node.js (v16 or later), Python (v3.9 or later), Docker, etc.]
- **Fork the Repository:** Go to the [Project Name] repository on [Platform, e.g., GitHub, GitLab] and fork it to your own account.
- **Clone Your Fork:** Clone your forked repository to your local machine:
  ```bash
  git clone https://[Platform domain]/[YourUsername]/[Project Name].git
  cd [Project Name]
  ```
- **Install Dependencies:** Install the project's dependencies. This will vary depending on the project, but often involves using a package manager like `npm`, `pip`, or `yarn`. Refer to the project's `README` or setup instructions for specific commands (e.g., `npm install`, `pip install -r requirements.txt`).
- **Build the Project (if necessary):** Some projects require a build step. Again, check the `README` for build instructions.
- **Run Tests:** Ensure the existing tests pass in your environment. This helps confirm your setup is correct. (e.g., `npm test`, `pytest`).

### 3. Find Something to Work On

There are many ways to contribute to ONE Local:

- **Check the Issue Tracker:** Look at the issue tracker for open issues labeled "good first issue," "help wanted," or "bug." These are often good starting points for new contributors.
- **Review Feature Requests:** Browse the issue tracker for feature requests to see if there's something you'd like to implement.
- **Improve Documentation:** Documentation is crucial! If you find areas that are unclear, incomplete, or outdated, documentation improvements are always welcome.
- **Report Bugs:** If you encounter a bug, please report it by creating a new issue in the issue tracker. Detailed bug reports are very helpful.
- **Suggest Features:** Have a great idea for a new feature? Open a feature request issue to discuss it with the community.
- **Ask for Guidance:** If you're unsure where to start, reach out to us! You can use our communication channels (see below) to ask for suggestions.

## Contribution Workflow

### 1. Reporting Issues

If you find a bug, have a feature request, or any other issue, please create a new issue in our issue tracker. When reporting issues, please be as clear and detailed as possible:

- **Descriptive Title:** Use a clear and concise title that summarizes the issue.
- **Detailed Description:** Explain the issue in detail, including:
  - What you were trying to do.
  - What you expected to happen.
  - What actually happened.
  - Steps to reproduce the issue (if applicable).
  - Your environment (operating system, browser, software versions, etc.).
- **Labels (if you can):** Use appropriate labels to categorize the issue (e.g., "bug," "feature request," "documentation").

### 2. Submitting Pull Requests (PRs)

When you're ready to contribute code, follow these steps:

- **Create a Branch:** Create a new branch in your forked repository for your changes. Use a descriptive branch name, ideally related to the issue you're addressing (e.g., `fix-login-bug`, `add-documentation-section`).
  ```bash
  git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
  ```
- **Make Your Changes:** Implement your changes, following our coding standards (see below).
- **Test Your Changes:** Run the project's tests to ensure your changes haven't introduced regressions and that new features are properly tested. Write new tests if necessary.
- **Commit Your Changes:** Commit your changes with clear and concise commit messages (see commit message guidelines below).
- **Push to Your Fork:** Push your branch to your forked repository.
  ```bash
  git push origin feature/your-feature-name
  ```
- **Create a Pull Request:** Go to the original [Project Name] repository on [Platform] and create a new pull request from your forked branch to the main branch (usually `main` or `master`).
- **PR Description:** In your pull request description, please:
  - Reference the issue your PR addresses (e.g., "Fixes #123").
  - Describe the changes you've made and why.
  - Explain any decisions you made or trade-offs considered.
  - Include any relevant screenshots or screen recordings if applicable (especially for UI changes).
- **Code Review:** Your pull request will be reviewed by project maintainers. Be prepared to address feedback and make revisions.

### 3. Coding Standards and Style Guides

To maintain code consistency and readability, please follow these guidelines:

- [**Link to Style Guide/Linter Configuration:** If you have a specific style guide (e.g., PEP 8 for Python, ESLint for JavaScript) or linter configuration, link to it here. If not, describe general style preferences, e.g., "Use consistent indentation (2 spaces), follow language-specific best practices, keep code concise and readable." ]
- **Keep Code Clean and Well-Commented:** Write clear, understandable code and add comments where necessary to explain complex logic.

### 4. Commit Message Guidelines

Write clear and informative commit messages. We prefer commit messages that follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification, but at a minimum, please:

- **Use a concise summary line:** Start with a short summary of the change (50 characters or less).
- **Optionally add a detailed body:** If the change is complex, add a more detailed body explaining the "why" and "how" of the change.
- **Reference issues or PRs:** If the commit relates to an issue or pull request, include a reference (e.g., "Fixes #123", "Closes #456", "See #789").

## License and Legal Information - Copyright Assignment

Thank you for considering contributing to ONE Local! We are a cooperative, and our goal is to build and steward this project for the long-term benefit of our community. To ensure the sustainability and community-focused nature of [Project Name], and in alignment with our project license (MIT License + Commons Clause + Use Exceptions), we operate under a Copyright Assignment model. Please read the following terms carefully to understand how your contributions will be managed.

### Understanding Copyright Assignment in our Cooperative Context

Unlike many open-source projects that operate on a licensing basis, ONE Local requires contributors to assign copyright of their contributions to the project owner ("the Cooperative"). We understand this is different from typical open-source contribution models, and we want to be transparent about why we've chosen this approach:

#### Ensuring Long-Term Sustainability & Stewardship:

As a cooperative, we are collectively responsible for the project's future. Copyright assignment allows the Cooperative to act as a unified entity to protect, maintain, and evolve the project over the long term, making strategic decisions in the best interest of the community. This approach is especially important for us given a past experience where a major contributor revoked permission to use their code. This revocation forced a significant rebuild, deeply impacting the co-op's resources and causing disruption within the Boulder community we serve. Copyright assignment helps prevent such destabilizing events in the future.

#### Supporting Community Benefit & Our Mission:

Our cooperative model is built to prioritize community benefit over individual profit. By owning the copyright, the Cooperative can responsibly manage the project's commercial aspects (as outlined in our license: MIT License + Commons Clause + Use Exceptions) to generate resources that can be reinvested in the project, supporting development, infrastructure, and community initiatives. This ensures the project's ongoing health and benefits our membership base directly. Furthermore, our license and this copyright assignment model are designed to allow for exceptions, enabling community organizations and non-profits to potentially use the project for community-benefit purposes under specific agreements. Please contact us if you believe your organization may qualify for such an exception.

#### Preventing Future Licensing Inconsistencies:

Copyright assignment provides clarity and avoids potential future fragmentation or licensing inconsistencies that can arise in projects where copyright remains distributed among many individual contributors. This unified copyright ownership simplifies long-term management and licensing for the benefit of everyone.

### Terms of Contribution - Copyright Assignment

By contributing any code, documentation, or other materials to this project (your "Contributions"), you assign all right, title, and interest in and to the copyright of your Contributions to ONE Local Cooperative ("Project Owner"). This assignment is effective immediately upon submission of your Contribution.

### Contributor Rights - License Back from the Cooperative

While you assign copyright of your contributions to ONE Local Cooperative, we want to ensure contributors also retain significant freedom to use their own contributions. Therefore, immediately upon your contribution being accepted, ONE Local Cooperative grants you back a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable license to your contributions under the MIT License.

This "license back" means that you, as the contributor, are explicitly granted the following rights with respect to your own contributions, even after copyright assignment to the Cooperative:

- **Use:** You are free to use your contributions for any purpose, including commercial purposes, in other projects, or in any way you see fit.
- **Modify:** You can modify your contributions as you wish, even after they become part of the ONE Local project.
- **Distribute:** You can distribute your original contributions (or modified versions) separately, as part of other projects, or in any way you choose.
- **Sublicense:** You can grant sublicenses to others to use your contributions under the MIT License terms.
- **No Royalties or Restrictions from the Cooperative:** The Cooperative will not claim royalties from you or impose any restrictions on your use of your own contributions under this license back.

### Important Clarifications about this License Back:

- **MIT License Terms Apply:** Your use of your contributions under this license back is governed by the terms of the MIT License, including the requirement to include the copyright notice and permission notice in copies or substantial portions of the software.
- **Cooperative Remains Copyright Owner:** This license back does not undo the copyright assignment. ONE Local Cooperative remains the copyright owner of your contributions and the project as a whole. This license simply grants you, the contributor, very broad rights to use your own contributions.
- **Project Licensing Remains Consistent:** The overall ONE Local project continues to be licensed under the MIT License + Commons Clause + Use Exceptions. This license back is an additional right granted specifically to contributors regarding their individual contributions.

This license back is intended to balance the Cooperative's need for copyright ownership for long-term stewardship with our commitment to empowering contributors and allowing them to freely use their own code.

### As the copyright owner, ONE Local Cooperative is committed to:

- **Maintaining the Project's Open and Community-Focused Nature:** We are dedicated to keeping [Project Name] accessible for non-commercial use by the community, as reflected in our project license (MIT + Commons Clause).
- **Transparent Stewardship:** We will be transparent about how the project is managed and how any commercial activities are used to support the project and its community.
- **Attribution and Recognition:** We will ensure proper attribution for your contributions, as required by the MIT License and in line with community best practices. We deeply value and appreciate every contribution.
- **Community Governance (Future Goal):** As the cooperative evolves, we aim to further involve our community and membership in the governance and direction of the project, ensuring it remains responsive to community needs.

### Important Considerations:

- **Irrevocable Assignment:** Please understand that this is a copyright assignment, and it is irrevocable. You are transferring ownership of your copyright to the Cooperative.
- **Non-Commercial Use for Contributors (Generally):** While the Cooperative owns the copyright, the project's license (MIT + Commons Clause) generally restricts commercial use for others without explicit permission. Exceptions for community organizations and non-profits remain possible under specific agreements.
- # **Contributions "As Is":** Your contributions are provided on an "as is" basis, without warranty or liability.
